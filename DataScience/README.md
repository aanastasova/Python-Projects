The project uses the data that can be downloaded from this link -> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maharshipandya/-spotify-tracks-dataset for the tracks data
and here -> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-600k-tracks/data the artist data was used. 

This project aims to create content-based music recommendation system. 
The main goal is to offer personalized music suggestions that closely match individual preferences. 
This aspiration arises from the need to enhance user satisfaction by providing recommendations that truly resonate.
An important step involves conducting a detailed analysis of the dataset, known as Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). 
This process involves closely examining how data is spread out, how different pieces of data relate to each other, and patterns in how user interacts with music. 
This is done using both graphs and analytical methods. We aim to understand the mechanics of recommendation systems, emphasizing content-based methods, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Cosine Similarity. 
Our ultimate goal is to build a sophisticated recommendation system that tailors song suggestions to each user's unique preferences.
The core insight here is that music is deeply personal. No two individuals have the exact same musical taste. We're bridging this gap by combining musical features with data science techniques. 
Our journey begins by analyzing audio features like danceability, energy, tempo, and more, to uncover patterns within our music collections.
We then use SVM to classify tracks, transforming musical attributes into meaningful categories. 
PCA simplifies our analysis by reducing the complexity of musical attributes. 
Finally, Cosine Similarity helps us construct personalized recommendations that align with individual musical preferences.
This project is all about personalization. We believe that every music enthusiast deserves a recommendation system that resonates with their individuality. 
We're working to turn that belief into a reality by combining data and algorithms to create a recommendation system.
In essence, this project encompasses a blend of technology, analysis, and musical passion, all aimed at crafting an outstanding music recommendation experience.
