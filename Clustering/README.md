The project explores traditional clustering algorithms - K-means clustering and Agglomerative Clustering, find in this project the mathematical theory behind 
these techniques explained and custom implementation of the K-means algorithms. The importance of the distance metric is studied in depth. 
Further, Data Analysis is performed together with detailed, graphically backed explanations of the results obtained in the project.

The main objective of this project is to address a real-life problem in the retail industry by exploring a retail dataset using the K-means clustering algorithm. 
The analysis focuses on two key features in the chosen data: "frequency" and "revenue." 
The goal is to gain insights into customer segmentation based on purchasing behavior and identify potential loyal customers and high-value customers.
The analysis aims to investigate the impact of different distance metrics, including a custom distance metric, on the resulting clusters. 
By designing a custom distance metric that assigns more weight to either the "frequency" or "revenue" feature, we seek to highlight the influence of these factors on customer segmentation.
